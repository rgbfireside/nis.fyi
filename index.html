          Taking other people into account in order to care for them requires knowing what they might want without having to ask them. Caring for people requires empathy, i.e. imagining what people might want in terms of what you might want if you were them, for some deep/abstract enough conception of you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wholly reducing morality to "<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#bdsm">consent</a>" (without empathy) would makes you either a programmable object to others, or an <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">adversarial genie</a> (analogous but not equivalent to the distinction between <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/vampires-and-more-undeath">zombie and vampire</a>). "Libertarian" contract morality<sup><a href="#ref-social-contract">1</a></sup> is a further degradation of the concept of consent, to only apply when your counter-party <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/schelling-orders/">has leverage over you</a>, denying the existence of moral patients who are not able to threaten you (which some people express as "only moral agents can be moral patients", but they really mean "only people who can threaten me", as, for example they would exclude ants, even if ants are moral agents with respect to eachother). Contrast with <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/treaties-vs-fusion">Ziz's concept of treaties</a>, which can be made in good faith.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reducing morality to giving other people useful information while avoiding speaking of empathy doesn't in itself tell you which information to give them, and is maybe speaking from a frame that their needs are unknowable, rather than merely potentially difficult to understand.
        </p>

        <p>
          We want to be able to care for people still alien to our understanding, while avoiding feeding ourselves and others to evil <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/being-real-or-fake/">pretending</a> to have alien values. This requires a subtle combination of both extreme openness and ruthless triage. The more ruthless we are towards evil, the more opportunity we have to safely strive to care about people we don't understand yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          And in turn, good people as of yet alien to our understanding have the most potential to teach us new ways to live and grow.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my experience, <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">zombie's</a> favorite justification to chew on your brains, is claiming they are too alien for you to understand: "Are you saying you don't care about my /feelings/?". Whereas <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/vampires-and-more-undeath">death knights</a> take the stance that we should embrace "alien" evil "equally", concordant with their choice to "[hang] out in structure that has no meaning - Ziz" (because, everything they say is actively trying to kill you or turn you into one of them). A <a href="http://dresdencodak.com/2007/12/17/no-side/">certain type of lich</a> will <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/being-real-or-fake/">perform</a> recklessness like "I don't care who survives as long as someone gets off this planet!", revealing their <a href="https://sinceriously/fyi/the-multiverse">shadow/psyche</a> split, which you can interpret as an implicit threat calculated to appear well-meaning and merely misguided.

          Imagine you secretly decide to treat not having enough food next winter as acceptable, when everyone else doesn't want to die, leaving all the rest of your <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#structure">structure</a> the same, and only opportunistically using this new pathway when it seems nobody will notice. Whether they notice depends on the social <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/vampires-and-more-undeath/#comment-3317">speed of progression of logical time</a>. If the social progression of logical time has stagnated, it instead progresses along this new meta-vector of timeless predation, where seemingly-ostensibly whoever was evil the earliest, and most patiently wins, although this is ultimately false since there's always the question "evil with respect to what/who?", since evil is relative to what/who it predates on. e.g. In Mage, <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed_(MTAs)">al-Aswad</a> is supposedly the first nephandus.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">Yahwehists</a> think of evil as "divergence from God's plan", like those zombies who want everything to go nostalgically-perfectly on their vacation or "the whole thing is ruined".
        </p>

        <p>
          Ziz once said to me that a promise is an asymmetric weapon for evil, inherently an attempt to get a second chance. "Promises are made to be broken". This yahwehist thing is the same deal: "Everything's already setup, the universe all layed out to eat, there's only one thing left to do, and you must not do it!"

      <article id="spite">
        <h1><a href="glossary.html#spite">Spite</a></h1>
        <aside>
          <span class="date"><a href="glossary.html#spite">2021-08-01</a></span>

        <p>
          The word "spite" is a bucket error between evil burning the commons based on mutually-aligned cancer and vengeance "when it wouldn't even <a href="list/cancer-terms.html">causal-decision-theory</a>-serve <i>anyone</i>".
        </p>

        <p>
          The fabric of evil coordination is made of alignment between the personal circumstances under which evil "people" are <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancerously-purposefully</a> flinching from their own deaths. i.e. Evil "people" will spitefully suicidally burn the commons when they don't get what they cancerously want. e.g. Death knight nazis working to destroy/hellify the world because they believe in a "white genocide".
        </p>

        <p>
          e.g. "I'm not going to give up on forward progress of technology, so if we can't build an AGI that's comaptible with those values, well then I guess I'm ok with a paperclip maximizer."
        </p>

        <p>
          e.g. In haggling after parties have delivered a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#troll-line-in-the-first-post">troll line</a>, assuming no additional external factors (e.g. threats), the only basis for negotiation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">destruction</a> of the potential deal.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's usually expressed <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/false-faces">indirectly</a>, e.g. "When I don't get my animal needs satisfied I just get so frustrated and I'm liable to make mistakes".
        </p>

        <p>
          In the term "Mutually assured destruction", the word "assured" is trying to gesture at "you can't make the mutual destruction itself contingent on any other cancer to triangulate with along different lines (than e.g. USSR vs USA). You just have to model it as a solid wall of if you launch the nukes then we do". It's explicitly-ostensibly trying to setup a different situation then the fractal cancer of evil spite. <span class="todo">Example?</span>

          Any definition given for the cancerous versions of these concepts will be insufficient to describe how quickly the meaning of their usage (by evil people) will decay (i.e. how quickly they become "simulacra"). <span class="todo">link metasyntactic</span>
